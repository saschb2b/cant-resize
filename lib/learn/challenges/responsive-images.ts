    explanationCorrect:
      "Setting `width` and `height` attributes lets the browser calculate the aspect ratio and reserve space before the image loads. Combined with `width: 100%` and `height: auto`, the image scales responsively while preventing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).",
    explanationWrong:
      "Without dimensions, the browser doesn't know how tall the image will be until it downloads. The page content shifts downward when the image loads, causing a poor CLS score and a jarring user experience.",

    explanationWrong:
      "A plain `<img>` serves the same 800px image to every device. A mobile user downloads 4x more pixels than needed. No lazy loading, no modern format negotiation, no srcSet. `next/image` handles all of this.",

    explanationWrong:
      "A 1600x600 panoramic image on a 375px phone becomes a tiny strip where you can't see the subject. Art direction means changing the crop/composition, not just the resolution. Use `<picture>` when the image needs different framing at different sizes.",

    explanationWrong:
      "`sizes=\"100vw\"` tells the browser this image fills the viewport. But in a 3-column grid, each image is only ~33% of the viewport. The browser downloads a 1440px-wide image when a 480px-wide one would suffice — wasting 3x the bandwidth.",

    explanationWrong:
