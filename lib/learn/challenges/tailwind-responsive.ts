    explanationWrong:
      "Two problems: `flex-row` and `flex-col` only set `flex-direction` and they don't add `display: flex`. Without the `flex` class, the container isn't a flex container at *any* screen size. Second, the responsive prefixes are backwards. Start with the mobile layout unprefixed, then override for larger screens.",

      "`hidden md:block` compiles to `display: none` by default and `display: block` at 768px+. Pure CSS, no JavaScript, no hydration issues, no resize listeners. Tailwind's responsive prefixes are the standard way to show/hide elements.",
    explanationWrong:
      "`window.innerWidth` breaks SSR. A resize listener adds complexity for something CSS handles natively. The component unmounts on mobile, losing its state. Tailwind's `hidden md:block` is simpler and more robust.",

    explanationWrong:

      "Tailwind's `@container` and `@sm:` prefixes generate CSS container queries. The card adapts to its parent's width, not the viewport. If this card is in a sidebar, it stays in column layout even on a wide desktop.",
    explanationWrong:
      "`md:flex-row` triggers at 768px viewport width regardless of where the card is placed. In a 300px sidebar on a 1440px screen, the card still switches to row layout because the *viewport* is wide. Container queries fix this.",
