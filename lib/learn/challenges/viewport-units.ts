    explanationCorrect:
      "`100vh` on mobile includes the area behind the browser's URL bar, so content gets hidden. `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height) adjusts when the browser chrome appears or disappears, giving you the actual visible height.",
    explanationWrong:
      "On mobile Safari and Chrome, `100vh` is taller than the visible area because it includes the space behind the collapsible URL bar. Users see a cut-off hero section and can't reach content at the bottom without scrolling.",

}`,
    lang: "css",
    correctSide: "right",
    explanationCorrect:
      "`svh` (small viewport height) is the viewport with all browser chrome visible — the smallest the viewport can be. For fixed elements, this prevents content from jumping when the URL bar collapses. Use `dvh` for full-screen heroes, `svh` for fixed/sticky UI.",
    explanationWrong:
      "`dvh` changes as the browser chrome animates in and out, causing the fixed footer's height to constantly resize as the user scrolls. `svh` gives a stable value based on the smallest viewport state.",

    lang: "css",
    correctSide: "right",
    explanationCorrect:
      "`min(90%, 1200px)` caps the container at 1200px on large screens while staying 90% wide on small screens — no media query needed. Using `%` instead of `vw` also respects parent constraints if the container is nested, and `margin-inline` is the logical property equivalent.",
    explanationWrong:
      "`90vw` always refers to the viewport, even inside a nested container. If this `.container` is inside a 50%-width sidebar, it will overflow because `90vw` is relative to the full screen, not the parent. Percentage-based widths respect the parent.",

.page {

    lang: "css",

    explanationCorrect:
      "`100vw` includes the scrollbar width on Windows/Linux, causing a horizontal scrollbar. `100%` refers to the containing block's width, which excludes the scrollbar. For section heights, `100dvh` gives the correct visible area on mobile.",
    explanationWrong:
      "`100vw` is the full viewport including the scrollbar (typically 15-17px on Windows). This creates a horizontal overflow that's invisible on macOS (overlay scrollbar) but breaks the layout on Windows. Never use `100vw` for full-width elements.",

    explanationCorrect:
      "CSS cascade lets you declare `100vh` first as a fallback for older browsers, then `100dvh` which modern browsers will use. Browsers that don't understand `dvh` ignore the second declaration and keep `100vh`. This is progressive enhancement in one rule.",
    explanationWrong:
      "While `dvh` has good browser support now, older browsers and some WebViews still don't support it. Without a `vh` fallback, the hero gets no height at all in unsupported browsers — it collapses to content height.",
