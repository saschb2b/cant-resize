      "DevTools device mode is a viewport resizer, not a device emulator. It can't simulate touch physics, mobile browser chrome, virtual keyboards, or Safari's CSS quirks. A layered testing approach catches issues at each level before they reach production.",

    explanationWrong:
      "Manually resizing a single browser window means you can only see one viewport at a time. You miss how changes at one breakpoint affect others, and the constant resizing is slow. Multi-device viewers solve both problems.",
